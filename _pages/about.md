Welcome! I'm a recent PhD graudate studying Aerospace Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. As a researcher I am a member of Ufuk Topcu's [Autonomous Systems Group](https://oden.utexas.edu/research/centers-and-groups/autonomous-systems-group/).
Prior to my graduate studies I received a Bachelors of Engineering/Bachelors of Science in aerospace and mathematics from the University of Sydney. 

**Research Interests**
My research interests include the intersection of control and learning in autonomous systems with a focus on aerospace applications. In particular, my focus in on theory and algorithms for assured autonomy in the presence of partially observability and uncertainty. I have studied how to integrate formal verification and synthesis with data-driven methods such as reinforcement learning and deep learning.
