Welcome! I'm a postdocorate fellow at the Oden Institute for Computational Sciences, located at the University of Texas at Austin. As a researcher I am a member of Ufuk Topcu's [Autonomous Systems Group](https://oden.utexas.edu/research/centers-and-groups/autonomous-systems-group/). In 2022, I graduated with my PhD in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin specializing in decision-making for *Task-Aware Planning and Learning in Partially Observable Environments*. 
Prior to my graduate studies I received a Bachelors of Engineering/Bachelors of Science in aerospace and mathematics from the University of Sydney. 

**Research Interests**

My research interests include the intersection of control and learning in autonomous systems with a focus on aerospace applications. In particular, my focus is on theory and algorithms for assured autonomy in the presence of partial observability and uncertainty. I have studied how to integrate formal verification and synthesis with data-driven methods such as reinforcement learning and deep learning.

**Skills and Abilities**

I have a lot of experience coding in both Python and C++. In particular, I implemented customized deep networks (CNNs, LSTMS, RNNs and GRUs) in both Tensorflow and PyTorch. For deep reinforcement learning, I can parallelize training across multiple instances, safe learning on PPO, discrete SAC, DQN, DRQN and REINFORCE. For deployed agents (UAVs and Turtlebots) I use the robot operating system (ROS).
